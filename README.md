# kcov-bats-circleci-codeclimate

A small example on how to set up [kcov] for gathering [bats] Bash script test
coverage in combination with [CircleCI] and [Code Climate]. 


The kcov version on the Ubuntu repositories is quite outdated, so this example
uses a self-compiled version.

[Code Climate]: https://codeclimate.com/
