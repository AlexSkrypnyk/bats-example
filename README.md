# kcov-circleci-codeclimate

A small example on how to set up [kcov] in combination with [CircleCI] and
[Code Climate]. 


The kcov version on the Ubuntu repositories is quite outdated, so this example
uses a self-compiled version.

[CircleCI]: https://circleci.com
[Code Climate]: https://codeclimate.com/
[kcov]: https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov/
